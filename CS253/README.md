#CS253 - Software Development with C++

## Final project:
This C++ code returns the name of a document that:
  * Is within a desired reading level
  * Is the most similar to a query document

It takes 4 arguments: A query document, a document containing a series of filenames to be reviewed, and 2 numbers designating
  the desired reading level. Specifically, the second document contains the name of an exceptions file, then the list of filenames
  to be processed.
