## CS410 - Introduction to Graphics

During the Fall semester of 2018, this course taught me how to create a ray tracer from scratch. We added features such as:
  -Smoothing<br>
  -Recursive Ray Tracing<br>
  -Refraction<br>
  -Object Transformation<br>
  -Specular, Diffuse, and Ambient Lighting<br>

The professor of this course requested that I would not publicly post the code I created during the semester. However, I can
  privately provide the code if requested.
  
In the meantime, some of the scenes that I developed throughout the semester are available to view. My code generated the ppm files, but I converted them to jpeg images for you to view.
